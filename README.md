# final-project
 final project for cs196: A gamified habit tracker (wip), built from the grounds up using pygame

## Current Features:
- Save, Load, Create new users
- Add a habit you want to follow, get garden points when you complete them

# In progress:
- The garden feature where you can buy plants from your garden points
- achievement for sticking to a habit for 90 days


# Run the main.py file to start, name your user "test" to get the next day button so you dont have to wait for habits to reset
